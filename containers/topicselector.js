/*!
 * Description: TopicSelector container component
 *
 * We are using mapStateToProps to subscribe to Redux store updates. Any time
 * the store will updates, mapStoreToProps will be called and pass the changed state
 * as props to the TopicSelector component.
 *
 * The props we will pass are;
 * - topic, string containing the text the user entered
 *
 * We are also using mapDispatchToProps to pass action creators as props to the
 * TopicSelector component. The object we are passing include functions with
 * the same names, but with every action creator wrapped into a dispatch call
 * so they may be invoked directly.
 *
 * The action creators we pass as props are;
 * - setTopic()
 * - fetchTopic()
