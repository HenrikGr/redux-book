/*!
 * Description: TopicSelectorContainer component
 *
 * The component is a container component with the purpose of subscribe
 * to the Redux store and pass changes as props to the TopicSelector component.
 *
 * The app component hierarchy looks like this:
 *
 * App
 *  - ControlsContainer
 *   - TopicSelectorContainer (*)
 *    - TopicSelector
 *   - DisplayModeContainer
 *    - DisplayMode
 *   - HistoryContainer
 *    - History
 *  - BooksContainer
 *   - Book
 *   - Book
 *   - ...
 *  - StateViewerContainer
 *
 * We are using mapStateToProps to subscribe to Redux store updates. Any time
 * the store will updates, mapStoreToProps will be called and pass the changed state
 * as props to the TopicSelector component.
 *
 * The props we will pass are;
 * - topic, string containing the text the user entered
 *
 * We are also using mapDispatchToProps to pass action creators as props to the
 * TopicSelector component. The object we are passing include functions with
 * the same names, but with every action creator wrapped into a dispatch call
 * so they may be invoked directly.
 *
 * The action creators we pass as props are;
 * - setTopic()
 * - fetchTopic()
