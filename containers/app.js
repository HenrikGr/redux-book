/*!
 * Description: App component
 *
 * The app uses the Google Books REST API to asynchronously search for books. After the user
 * enters a topic into the text field and presses Enter, the application fetches information
 * for the first 10 books that match the topic, displaying a thumbnail of each book's cover.
 *
 * The book thumbnails are links. When you click one, you see more information about the book
 * on books.google.com.
 *
 * The application supports undo (by clicking the left arrow) and redo (by clicking the right arrow),
 * along with a history slider that moves you back and forth among the application's previous states.
 *
 * The component hierarchy looks like this:
 *
 * App
 *  - Controls
 *   - TopicSelector
 *   - DisplayOption
 *   - History
 *  - Books
 *   - Book
 *   - Book
 *   - ...
 *  - StateViewer
