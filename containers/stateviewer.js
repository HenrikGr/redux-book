 * Description: StateViewer container component.
 *
 * The StateViewer container component subscribes to the application state,
 * located in the Redux store and when any changes occur to the state,
 * the StateViewer component will receive them as props.
 *
 * We declare all of the application states in mapStateToProps and make sure
 * the StaeViewer component will receive them when changes by the connect API.
