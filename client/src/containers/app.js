/*!
 * Description: App component
 *
 * The app uses the Google Books REST API to asynchronously search for books. After the user
 * enters a topic into the text field and presses Enter, the application fetches information
 * for the first 10 books that match the topic, displaying a thumbnail of each book's cover.
 *
 * The book thumbnails are links. When you click one, you see more information about the book
 * on books.google.com.
 *
 * The application supports undo (by clicking the left arrow) and redo (by clicking the right
 * arrow), along with a history slider that moves you back and forth among the application's
 * previous states.
 *
 * The app component hierarchy looks like this:
 *
 * App (*)
 *  - ControlsContainer
 *   - TopicSelectorContainer
 *    - TopicSelector
 *   - DisplayModeContainer
 *    - DisplayMode
 *   - HistoryContainer
 *    - History
 *  - BooksContainer
 *   - Book
 *   - Book
 *   - ...
 *  - StateViewerContainer
